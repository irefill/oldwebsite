We are two meticulous young people who believe in a clean future for all. We are students and contribute to the Zero Waste community through
our personal experiences and creative ideas.

## Giulia

Hello, I am Giulia

## Sebastian

I am Sebastian, an informatics student in Bolzano. Ever since I was a child, I have been fascinated by the mountains and nature, and I have always strived to contribute to important issues such as climate change and freedom for all.
